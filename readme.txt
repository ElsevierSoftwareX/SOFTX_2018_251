This ART data analyzer package is a python package that analyze the physical quantities change between two atomic configurations of each possible event search of using ART. The goal is to correlate the change in atomic structure with the change of activation energy. 

Currently, it can output the information such as atomic strain (e.g. the volumetric and shear strain) as a statistical distribution. It also implement the physically meaningful atomic structure descriptor SOAP matrix for a complete representation of atomic structure within a local environment.

This package has the following modules and sub-packages:

/src contains all the source code of various libraries, majorly in python, it may also contains other code such as Matlab or C code

data_reader: extracting data from various data file formats (default format lammps dump file), read data into a pandas.Dataframe

event_selector: locate the accepted event to be analyzed while preventing redundant event search

Util: utilities containing various classes and functions for other modules

calculator package:
	strain_calculator: calculate the atomic strain for a specific event

	stress_calculator, voronoi analysis coming soon

visualator package:
	strain_visualator: visualize the atomic strain from stored atomic strain results 	in results.pkl file


/examples: contains examples of executable running scripts and demo data. The demo example system is CuZr metallic glass.

/scripts: contains executable scripts that will be directly invoked on the command line

/tests: contains unittests to test various modules



Operating system:
This python package depends on some python packages such as mpl_toolkits, scikit-learn. User need to verify the successful installation of these dependencies in their OS.

How to install/use this python package:
This package is written in python scripting language to analyze the atomic configuration data generated by ART atomistic simulation software. There is no need to compile and build python code. This package can be put in any directory. Ensure to source the environment.sh before using this package. The purpose is to create the necessary environmental variables PYTHONPATH/PATH/TEST_PROJ for current bash sessions to find the python packages/exe scripts/test directory.

Executable files:
art_data: exe script
prompt the options that can use for various analyzing feature of the python package
Use sys.argparser to parse the user input from terminal
-calc/-c invoke the art_data_calculator exe 
-v invoke the art_data_visualization exe
-m invoke the correlation model exe by adopting the various data models implemented in scikit-learn machine learning package
